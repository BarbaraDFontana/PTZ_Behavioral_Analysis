In this folder, there are 5 files necessary for creating the model

Script 1. Setup the data making it clear to read for future analysis.
Script 2. Creates sliding windows with postural information for the random forest model, creating a final file with testing and training dataset.
Script 3. Trains the RF model itself, evaluating which MTRY is the best for the model and shows a graph with accuracy calculated for testing data.
Script 4. Similar to script two, all the data with the sliding windows are set up to analyze the results of animal behavior.
Script 5. RF output for all the data, saving individual values for time analysis and a summary data for overall values. Brings up the IDs so the info of every fish, such as sex, age etc, are presented.
